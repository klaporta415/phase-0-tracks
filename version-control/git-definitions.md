# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
Version control allows multiple developers to work on different features and merge with the master branch. It also prevents code from being lost or mistakes being made because you are able to go back to previous versions. 
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
A branch is a file off of the master where features of the file will be worked on. Once edits are made, the changes can be merged with the master. This allows the code to be worked on while maintaining the master in case mistakes are made.
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
A commit saves changes made in a branch or file. A good commit message is detailed and explains what changes or additions were made.
* What is a merge conflict?
A merge conflict happens when conflicting actions are taken on the same file- such as one developer deletes a file and another makes changes and commits them to that file. When merging these branches, Git will not know which to merge and the conflict will need to be resolved.
