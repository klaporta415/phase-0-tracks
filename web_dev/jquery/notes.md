Learning Plan:

Resource Search:
- jQuery google searches including words like "introduction", "beginner"
- Find cheatsheets
- Find youtube videos using similar google search terms
- Look for any jQuery docs that might exist
- Browse JavaScript &jQuery book by Jon Duckett with remaing time
- Take notes, make bookmarks along the way


- I plan on testing what I learn as I go - with each new concept/category
- I think taking breaks will be important but it is a short period of time so I will try to limit. One or two 5-10 min breaks.
