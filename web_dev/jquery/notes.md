Learning Plan:

Resource Search:
- jQuery google searches including words like "introduction", "beginner"
- Find cheatsheets
- Find youtube videos using similar google search terms
- Look for any jQuery docs that might exist
- Browse JavaScript &jQuery book by Jon Duckett with remaing time
- Take notes, make bookmarks along the way


- I plan on testing what I learn as I go - with each new concept/category
- I think taking breaks will be important but it is a short period of time so I will try to limit. One or two 5-10 min breaks.

Helpful Resources:
- LearnCode jQuery Tutorial (1-4 videos)

What worked/didn't work:
- I found the youtube tutorials I found to be pretty helpful because they were quick and covered the basics
- Going over some other resources was helpful 
- I found some great cheat sheets that I will definitely use in the future
- I think actually trying to make something using jQuery was the most useful thing I did
- It seems best to combine resources instead of picking one and really digging into it
