What is the difference between a GET request and a POST request? When might each be used?

	- GET - requests data from specified resource
	- POST - submits data to be processed to a specified resource
		(https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_httpmethods.asp)

	- GET should be used for "safe" actions and POST for "unsafe" actions
	- POST requests resubmit information already sent
	- GET requests are more useable
		- can be cached, can remain in browser history, can be bookmarked,
		can be distributed/shared, can be hacked
