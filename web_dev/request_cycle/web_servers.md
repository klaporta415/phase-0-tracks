What are some of the key design philosophies of the Linux operating system?
	- From what I have read, Linux differs from other OS in that it allows the user more control, which means less protections. A few different things I read mentioned Linux assuming that the user knows what they are doing - that they are computer literate.
	- Another important piece to Linux is that it is open source so anyone can access it for free.


In your own words, what is a VPS (virtual private server)? What, according to your research, are the advantages of using a VPS?
	- A VPS is a web server that is really just remote storage for your web applications. An advantage is that it can be accessed from anywhere since it does not exist in physical form but in your command line. It seems that there are many options when it comes to using VPS - so you are able to customize it to meet your needs. It can also be more cost-effective to use depending on your project.


Optional bonus question: Why is it considered a bad idea to run programs as the root user on a Linux system?

	- The root user has total access so it is the only user that has administrator privileges. You can run the program under a user and login in as root user for administrative purposes which makes it safer. Operating under a user other than root makes it more difficult to hack. It is also easy to make harmful changes as the root user and this can cause problems like deletions, reformatting, bugs. AND MORE!
