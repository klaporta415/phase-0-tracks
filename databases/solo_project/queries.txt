sqlite> SELECT * FROM family_members;
1|Kaley|2
2|Chloe|2
3|Pam|1
4|Kim|1
5|Rich|3
6|Nick|3

sqlite> SELECT * FROM family_members;
1|Kaley|2
2|Chloe|2
3|Pam|1
4|Kim|1
5|Mackenzie|3
6|Nick|3

sqlite> SELECT * FROM family_members INNER JOIN family_origin ON family_origin_id=family_origin.id;
1|Kaley|2|2|La Porta
2|Chloe|2|2|La Porta
3|Pam|1|1|Kusta
4|Kim|1|1|Kusta
5|Mackenzie|3|3|Rot
6|Nick|3|3|Rot
sqlite>

Display a narrower selection of columns (fewer columns than all of them, in other words) from both tables using one query.



Delete an item that meets some condition (you can choose a condition that makes sense).
