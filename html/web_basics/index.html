<body> <h1> "Hello, world!"</h1>

<p> There are a lot of benefits and drawbacks to having a dog for a pet. Below I will list the pros and cons:</p> 
<h2> Pros</h2>
<ul>
<li> They will love you no matter what </li>
<li> They are so cute </li>
<li> They have weird little personalities </li>
<li> They are <em>predictable</em> </li>
</ul>
<h2> Cons </h2>
<ul>
<li> Sometimes they're stinky </li>
<li> You have to collect their pooop and it confuses them - making them wonder what you're doing with all their poop?? </li>
<li> They're needy - they <strong>CAN'T</strong> do anything alone!</li>
<p> And now, I'll list some dogs I know in order of likeability (most to least): </p>
<ol>
<li> Lou (my son) </li>
<li> Gem </li>
<li> Frank </li>
<li> Milo </li>
</ol>
<p> And <strong>that's it!</strong></p>
